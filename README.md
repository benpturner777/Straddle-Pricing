# Straddle Pricer (Learning Project)

## What is this?

This is a small Python project that explores **pricing a straddle options strategy** using:

* a simple analytical approach, and
* a basic Monte Carlo simulation.

It is meant for **learning and experimentation**, not real trading or financial decisions.

---

## Why does this exist?

I built this project to:

* practice Python for mathematical finance
* better understand options payoffs and volatility
* experiment with Monte Carlo simulations and plotting results

---

## Tech stack

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

---

## Current status

**Learning / experimental project**

This code is not production-ready and is intentionally simplified.

---

## How to run it

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the file:

   ```
   python straddle_pricer.py
   ```

This will print some results to the console and display a plot.


## What I would improve next

* Separate reusable functions from demo / plotting code
* Add tests
* Make inputs configurable
* Improve the financial realism of the model
